      <p>Low-power and wide-area (LPWA) technologies have become popular in various IoT services, mainly due to their low power and long communication range characteristics. However, LPWA still suffers from limited coverage and reliability issues, especially in an urban area where line-of-sight (LOS) communication is hard to achieve. The problem gets worsening in massive IoT environments as LPWA is vulnerable to the collision because of its long transmission time and unsophisticated Aloha-based MAC, which gets worse as the number of contending devices increases. Placing a relay forwarder between end-devices and gateway is introduced in some studies to extend coverage and to enhance communication reliability of LPWA. However, most previous studies adopt fixed-routing protocols for the relay. These fixed path approaches are vulnerable to the dynamicity of wireless propagation and make little use of multiple receptions, so it may easily lead to unnecessary forwarding that may raise collisions aggravating overall reliability and performance. We propose an opportunistic routing protocol for LPWA forwarders to make good use of multiple receptions. To suppress unnecessary forwarding, we adopt an on-demand/feedback message mechanism that is used by relays to determine whether to forward a packet or not. We also employ a network coding in generating forwarding packets in relays to increase the reliability and throughput further. As header overhead of network coding may exceed the size limitation of the LPWA packet, we use a header compression technique to encounter it.</p>

      <p>LPWA technologies have gain more attention in various IoT service as it provides long transmission range between devices to devices with low power consumption. Compared to WiFi and Bluetooth that use 2.4-GHz for short-range com-munication, LPWA works on the  sub-GHz band, allowinglonger transmission range up to 20km in LOS. Although thedata rate is only 0.3 kbit/s to 50 kbit/s [1], it enough for IoT applications such as smart  city or telemetry services thatsend small packet over wider coverage.</p>

      <p>In this thesis, we present feedback based opportunistic forwarding (FO) and feedback based opportunistic forwarding with network coding (FONC) as a forwarder mechanism to increase the LoRaWAN coverage, reliability, and scalability with better transmission efficiency. We propose this approach to overcome the limitation of one-hop star-of-stars in providing scalable long-range communication. Compared to the previous studies, we consider unnecessary forwarding as one of the drawbacks of a typical relay forwarder. In our mechanism, relay only forward when the packet is lost due to coverage limitation or obstacle problem (both temporal and permanent) that blocked a direct transmission to the gateway. 
Both FO and FONC show better reliability performance in increasing network coverage and suppressing unnecessary transmission compared to fixed-path forwarding. The multi-reception approach, feedback message, and network coding is the main mechanism to improve reliability. Whereas, the feedback approach prevents unnecessary forwarding. In fast data rate settings, the reliability is still stable around 99% for traffic load G=2.1 (1200 number of end-devices). On the other hand, the performance in slow data rate degrades faster. We present minimum RSSI and maximum RSSI based adaptive data rate (ADR) to overcome the scalability issue in LoRa network. The result shows that minADR selection gives better performance for end-devices below 600 owing to exploitation on multi-reception. Otherwise, maxADR is preferred because the result is more stable above 70% although we increase the end-device up to 1200.</p>
