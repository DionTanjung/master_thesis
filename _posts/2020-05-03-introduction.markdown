LPWA technologies have gain more attention in variousIoT service as it provides long transmission range betweendevices to devices with low power consumption. Comparedto WiFi and Bluetooth that use 2.4-GHz for short-range com-munication,  LPWA  works  on  the  sub-GHz  band,  allowinglonger transmission range up to 20km in LOS. Although thedata rate is only 0.3 kbit/s to 50 kbit/s [1], it enough for IoTapplications  such  as  smart  city  or  telemetry  services  thatsend small packet over wider coverage.There  are  several  LPWA  technologies  provided  in  themarket  based  on  licensed  band  (LTE-M  [2]  and  NB-IoT[3])  and  unlicensed  band(Sigfox[4]  and  LoRa[5]).  Amongthem, LoRa or long-range radio, using a CSS (Chirp SpreadSpectrum) modulation technique, is a popular LPWA radiotechnology  adopted  worldwide.  LoRaWAN[6]  is  a  MAClayer specification to build a network based on LoRa radio.As  LoRaWan  is  an  open  standard,  it  becomes  popular  be-cause allowing researchers and developers to improve andmodify the specification to their needs.
